Hello, I'm Seonghyuk Im, Graduate student of KAIST, [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/home/). 'Im' is my family name.

My academic advisors are Prof. [Jaehoon Kim](https://sites.google.com/view/jaehoon-kim/home) and Prof. [Hong Liu](https://www.ibs.re.kr/ecopro/hongliu/).

I'm also a student researcher at the [Extremal COmbinatorics and PRObability group (ECOPRO)](https://www.ibs.re.kr/ecopro/) in the Institute for Basic Science (IBS).

My reserch interests lie in extremal graph theory and I'm also interested in computational complexity of graph problems.
